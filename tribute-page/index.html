                <blockquote>"There can be only one permanent revolutionâ€”a moral one; the regeneration of the inner man. How is this revolution to take place? Nobody knows how it will take place in humanity, but every man feels it clearly in himself. And yet in our world everybody thinks of changing humanity, and nobody thinks of changing himself."</blockquote><cite>--Leo Tolstoy</cite>
